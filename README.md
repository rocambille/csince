# CSince

## End of this project

_2023-10-01_

This project was started in 2016 to provide a missing data in [CMake documentation pages](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/): what version a feature was adding to.
I was very proud to share this little stone with the community.
But today in 2023, the Cmake documentation now includes everything that my extension could provide.
This project therefore no longer has any reason to exist, and it is without regret that I have decided to stop its development.
It was an opportunity for me to learn on many levels.
Thank you to the people who contributed to it, hoping that it was useful during its lifetime.

## What it did

This extension was triggered on [CMake documentation pages](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/).

It checked since which version the feature described in the page exists, and added the information to the page contents.
